    <!--Week 2 Journal-->
    <p>
        Week 2: 08/29/22 - 09/02/22<br>
        This is my first blog.<br>
        This week we worked on brainstorming our Rube Goldberg Machines this week.<br>
        Another thing we did was we learned about the different machines like pulleys, levers, inclined slopes, etc.<br>
        We also started Tinkercad to create 3D models of our brainstormed ideas.<br>
        It was enjoyable to make the model and I even made a model of my earbuds for our challenge.<br>
        It's fun to make models and see the things you envision come to life.<br>
        Another thing we did this week is learn how to code html and how to create these blogs for our website.<br>
        Some of the things we learned how to do with html include: headings, line breaks, horizontal rules, images, page links, and more.<br>
        Included below are some photos of my earbud model for the challenge.<br>

    <!--Week 3 Journal-->
    <p>
        Week 3: 09/05/22 - 09/09/22<br>
        This week we finalized our Rube Goldberg Machines on Tinkercad and chose which ones we were going to build in our groups.<br>
        We had to make sure all the measurements and details were accurate on our models.<br>
        We also had a challenge to accurately recreate an 'E' that our partner designed.<br>
        The challenge went smoothly for the most part but the 'E' that my partner designed had a couple of flaws.<br>
        The measurements weren't accurate so the lines for the 'E' didn't touch at the top.<br>
        Although there were a couple of mistakes in the design, it still tured out well.<br>

    <!--Week 4 Journal-->
    <p>
        Week 4: 09/12/22 - 09/16/22<br>
        This week we started building our Rube Goldberg Machines.<br>
        My group decided to use Ben's model for our project.<br>
        We finished building our model and started testing the model.<br>
        Our first test was successful but we have yet to try it with a ballon and needle attached.<br>

        <img src="Rube Goldberg 2.jpg"; border=1; width=170; height=120><br>
        Another thing we did this week was our week 4 challenge.<br>
        For this challenge we made paper boats and tested them with weights in water to see which ones would last the longest.<br>
        I was part of group 8 and our boat was able to last for the full five minutes.<br>
        Unfortunately, the boat didn't have enough weight on it so we weren't able to win.<br>
        We learned that the more surface tension the boat has, the longer it would last.<br>

    <!--Week 5 Journal-->
    <p>
        Week 5: 09/19/22 - 09/23/22<br>
        This week we made the finishing touches on our Rube Goldberg Machines.<br>
        We also officially started testing our machines with the baseball, needle, and balloon.<br>
        Our machine failed the first test but was successful the second attempt with no changes.<br>
        I think it might have failed the first time because the balloon wasn't aligned corretly with the needle.<br>
        We were also able to see the other engineering classes projects.<br>
        Surprisingly, their models were extremely different from ours.<br>
        Their machines were more complicated and used more resources than ours did.<br>
        It was interesting to see the difference in our machines.<br>

    <!--Week 6 Journal-->
    <p>
         Week 6: 09/26/22 - 09/30/22<br>
         This week we worked on our Laptop Dissection Project.<br>
         We got an old chromebook and disassembled it using a screwdriver.<br>
         There were many steps to follow and some steps were a bit difficult to do correctly.<br>
         But overall it was pretty enjoyable and fun to do.<br>
         It was cool being able to see the inside of computers and how each component works together.<br>
         After we disassembled the chromebook, we identified all the components in the chromebook and how they fit together.<br>
         Then, after we finished that we had to reassemble the computer.<br>
         I think that reassembling it was harder than taking it apart as we were missing some pieces.<br>
         Our group probably could have done better keeping track of where each screw goes.<br>

    <!--Week 7 Journal-->
    <p>
        Week 7: 10/03/22 - 10/07/22<br>
        This week we learned about bioengineering and the different types of bioengineering.<br>
        We designed our own animal prosthetics and I created a prosthetic beak for falcons.<br>
        After our initial design on paper, we went to Tinkercad and created a model of the prosthetics there.<br>
        We also did a challenge about following directions to create a peanut butter sandwitch.<br>
        First, we wrote step by step directions on how to construct a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.<br>
        We then watched as other people attempted to create a PB&J sandwich using our instructions.<br>
        I think I could have been more specific with my directions in order to create a more complete instruction manual.<br>

    <!--Week 8 Journal-->
    <p>
        Week 8: 10/10/22 - 10/14/22<br>
        This week we started designing our bottle rockets and built a model of it on Tinkercad.<br>
        For my bottle I just went with a simple design, ataching a cone at the top and adding three fins at the bottom.<br>
        I used tape to attach the cone and fins to the bottle.<br>
        Our goal with the model rockets is to make it go as far as it can horizontally.<br>
        We also started building our rockets on Friday and I think mine turned out okay.<br>
        It was intresting looking at the designs everyone else built and how it was different from mine.<br>
        We also did our challenge for the week.<br>
        This weeks challenge was to build something out of paper that we would later throw at a bucket.<br>
        The goal was the bucket but the paper airplane I build missed by a bit but it was still pretty close.<br>
        I think I could have gotten it way closer or even inside the bucket is I just threw it a different way.<br>

    <!--Week 9 Journal-->
    <p>
        Week 9: 10/17/22 - 10/21/22<br>
        This week we finalized our rocket designs and started building.<br>
        We decided whick rocket we were going to use and started assembling all of our parts.<br>
        We used cardboard, a spare bottle, tape, hot glue, and weights to build our rocket.<br>
        Using the cardboard we made fins for the rocket then glued them on with hotglue or tape.<br>
        Then, we cut out the top of another bottle for our cone which we secured with tape.<br>
        Finally, we added weights to the attached fin.<br>
        Once we finished building our rocket we did a couple of test by just throwing it around the hallway.<br>
        During the lauch a lot of the rockets did not go far but instead did several circles in the air.<br>
        Some of the rockets even went backwards.<br>
        Thankfully, our rocket went pretty far and didn't continuously flip over.<br>
        Although our rocket could have probably been improved further, I think we did pretty well with the design.<br>

    <!--Week 10 Journal-->
    <p>
        Week 10: 10/24/22 - 10/28/22<br>
        This week we did a challenge on how many candycorns could fit on a sheet of paper.<br>
        Using only 5 candycorns and a single sheet of paper, we calculated how many we would be able to fit on it.<br>
        We also made a filter using a plastic bottle, cotton ball, sand, and different sie rocks.<br>
        The filter was a part of our lesson on environmental engineering.<br>
        The order my group put in our resources was cotton ball, sand, medium rocks, and large rocks.<br>
        The water became noticably clearer the more times we put it through our filter.<br>

    <!--Week 11 Journal-->
    <p>
        Week 11: 10/31/22 - 11/04/22<br>
        This week we learned about electrical engineering.<br>
        We learned about circuits and the different components that go into making up a circuit board.<br>
        We also made TinkerCad's of different circuit boards.<br>
        The circuit board we made were in parallel and sequence circuits.<br>
        We used a breadboard on Tinkercad and a 3 or 9 volt battery.<br>
        The TinkerCad circuits were made up of resisters, LEDs, and wires.<br>
        We also learned about Ohms Law duing class and completed a worksheet on it.<br>

    <!--Week 12 Journal-->
    <p>
        Week 12: 10/31/22 - 11/04/22<br>
        This week we built the circuit boards we built on TinkerCad last week.<br>
        We got to experience what it's like to actually build a circuit in real life.<br>
        We used breadboards, wires, resisters, LEDs, and multimeters.<br>
        It was interesting and fun to make the circuit board and try to create it looking at pictures.<br>
        We also did a challenge on Thursday.<br>
        We calculated how long it would take to count to 1,000,000.<br>
        Another part of the challenge was to calculate how long it would take to sit through a math class.<br>
        The math class was 50 minutes everyday for 180 days.<br>

    <p>
        Week 13: 11/14/22 - 11/18/22<br>
        This week we started working with Arduino.<br>
        We set up our accounts and used the Arduino program to code LEDs.<br>
        We coded the LEDs to light up and blink at different intervals.<br>
        There were many different colors of LEDs to choose from, so we could create different patterns using them.<br>
        The coding felt similar to other coding languages except I wasn't sure how to input some variables.<br>
        Another thing we did in class this week was another challenge.<br>
        This time, the challenge was to find out wether CV had more doors or wheels.<br>
        We had a big debate after exploring around the school or arguments.<br>

    <!--Week 1 Journal-->
    <p>
        Week 1: 01/09/23 - 01/13/23<br>
        This is the first week of second semester.<br>
        This week we did our Shark Tank presentation.<br>
        We made up our own business ideas in groups and presented them as they do in Shark Tank.<br>
        My group's idea was an app where users could make their own avatar and put real existing clothes on it.<br>
        The purpose was to allow users to try one different clothes from different brands so see it they fit.<br>
        People could also use it to make outfits and ideas before purchasing the clothes.<br>
        The app would also take user input to create outfits it thinks the user would enjoy.<br>
        One thing we realized when taking questions was that some clothes need to actually be tried on.<br>
        Even if the size looks right, it might feel off when they try wearing it.<br>

    <p>
        Week 2: 01/16/23 - 01/20/23<br>
        This week we learned about chemical engineering.<br>
        Our challenge this week was to figure out how to remove chlorine and bromine from a lake.<br>
        The objective had to be accomplishable in a short period of time, and not cost too much.<br>
        It also had to give no harm to the ecosystem around it.<br>
        My group first came up with the idea of adding some kind of chemical to the water.<br>
        The real solution was to dump a bunch of black balls into the water.<br>
        We also made oobleck using starch and water.<br>
        We used a ratio of 0.5 to 1 of water to starch and mixed it well, combining it all together.<br>

    <!-- Week 3-8 Project Journal-->
    <p>
        Week 3-8: 01/23/23 - 03/03/23<br>
        During these few weeks, we continuously worked on our semester 2 group projects.<br>
        I was in a group with Ashley and Yenah, and we decided to do the bio project.<br>
        We came up with the idea to put up signs in front of all the cafeteria lines to help with traffic.<br>
        The idea was that each line would have one food so that students could line up at the line with the food they wanted.<br>
        We hoped that this would improve the wait times for food during lunch.<br>
        We also decided to find out which foods were more popular than others so that we could have more than one line for that food.<br>
        <br>
        The first thing that our group did was going to the cafeteria manager to talk about it.<br>
        The cafeteria manager said that our plan sounded good, so we made an appointment with Mr.Gonzalez.<br>
        While waiting for the day of our appointment to come, we made a poster that we could attach to the cafeteria windows as signs.<br>
        We messed up a bit with the measurements the first time so we had to remake it once.<br>
        <br>
        When the day of our appointment with Mr.Gonzalez came, we went to his office and told him about our idea.<br>
        He said that it sounded good and we decided to make a google form of all the foods we offer at school to see which ones were the most popular.<br>
        First we needed a list of all the food we offer here so we emailed the cafeteria manager and asked about it.<br>
        Our plan was to create a google form that all the students could fill out during homeroom.<br>
        And although for now we are planning to use posters made from paper, if possible we want to change it to a computer.<br>
        That way the cafeteria workers just need to press a button or input what they want on the signs instead of manually changing them.<br>

    <!--Week 9 Journal-->
    <p>
        Week 9: 03/06/23 - 03/10/23<br>
        This week after working on our projects we did a challenge.<br>
        This weeks challenge was to build a boat and see how far it goes through a gutter.<br>
        Each of our groups were given the same materials.<br>
        We had a plastic cup, two straws, three safety pins, two balloons, two post-it's, two sheets of paper, four popsicle sticks, and a piece of duck tape.<br>
        The first thing we did was cut the cup in halp vertically and tape to back together with the tops facing each other.<br>
        This ended up being too long so we had to cut a bit more off the top.<br>
        After we cut the cup, we made a sail for the boat and blew up some balloons to propell the boat.<br>
        After we had built everything, we went to test it out but unfortunatly both our balloons popped.<br>
        In the end, we were only aboe to go around 4 feet forward.<br>
